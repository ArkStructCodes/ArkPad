# ðŸŽ® ArkPad

ArkPad is a libre gamepad emulation app for your racing games on the computer.

> [!Warning]
> This app is in active development and unstable by nature.
> I am still exploring how to tailor this to my use case, so do not report any bugs or send me PRs.
> Currently it supports very few racing games. Games I have tested personally to work are the Forza titles on steam.
> Be sure to adjust your controller bindings ingame to default for now.
> This is planned to be configurable in future.


# Download

To install ArkPad, get it from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/ArkStructCodes/ArkPad/releases/latest).

You will also need to install the control server. Get it from [here](https://github.com/ArkStructCodes/gamepad-server).
Currently the only supported platform is linux as I currently do not have a Windows computer or Mac.
