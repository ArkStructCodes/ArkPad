# Download

To install ArkPad, get it from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/ArkStructCodes/ArkPad/releases/latest).

You will also need to install the control server from [here](https://github.com/ArkStructCodes/gamepad-server).
Only linux is supported as of now since I do not have a Windows PC or a Mac.
